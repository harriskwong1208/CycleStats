# What is CycleStats

CycleStats analyzes a dataset of global bike purchases, focusing on various aspects such as customer demographics and buying patterns. Using Excel's capabilities, the analysis includes the use of pivot tables, formulas, formatting, and charts to derive insights. Data cleaning techniques were applied to ensure accuracy and reliability, including the removal of duplicates, application of conditional formatting, and handling of invalid values. An interactive dashboard was created with slicers, enabling users to filter data by marital status, region, and education level, enhancing data visualization and user experience.
